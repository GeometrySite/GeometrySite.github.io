<h1 id="s3">Step 3: Adding content</h1>
<p>Once you have made your index and stylesheet, you need to add content to the pages. EMBEDDED BASIC HTML CODE HERE, EG. [HTML] [BODY] ECT</p>

<h1 id="s4">Step 4: Stylesheets</h1>
<p>Once you have added some basic content, you can customize the look from the CSS stylesheet. A CSS (Cascading Style Sheey) is where all of the text gets it font, buttons get their color ect.</p>

<h1 id="s5">Step 5: Adding New Pages</h1>
<p>Making new pages is how your site becomes unique. You need to add another .html file from your repository. Then link it from another page.</p>
