<h1 id="s1">Step 1: Using GitHub</h1>
<p>GitHub is a service that is free and easy to use. It can host websites that are written in html and css. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to format and structure a website. GitHub not only hosts your HTML websites, it will also store anything else that you want to keep to collaborate with others. </p>

<h1 id="s2">Step 2: Setting up</h1>
<p>After you have made your GitHub Account, you will need to set your site up. Once you are in, you need to make your first .html file. It has to be named index.html (otherwise nuclear war will break out). you can then insert your basic HTML outline.</p>

<h1 id="s3">Step 3: Adding content</h1>
<p>Once the basic outline is done, you can start adding anthing. With HTML, you can add special tags to represent what you want to add. For example a sample of text is represensted with a 'p'. You have to use the proper brackets to make the code work</p>

<h1 id="s4">Step 4: Stylesheets</h1>
<p>Once you have added some basic content, you can customize the look from the CSS stylesheet. A CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is how everything gets its look and style. CSS can not structure your website, it can only change the look or theme.</p>

<h1 id="s5">Step 5: Adding New Pages</h1>
<p>Making new pages is how your site becomes unique. You need to add another .html file from your repository. Then link it from another page. You can either link to another page of your website or a completely different site.</p>
